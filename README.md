# sql-spitting-image - Functional JS library modelled on SQL keywords.

This is a collection of JS functions that I created for blog posts at [http://matt-at.keyboard-writes-code.com/](http://matt-at.keyboard-writes-code.com/) which I never took seriously at the time, as they were only for the blog but ended up being pretty good (albeit with less tests than I would like).

For usage please refer to [my blog](http://matt-at.keyboard-writes-code.com/).
